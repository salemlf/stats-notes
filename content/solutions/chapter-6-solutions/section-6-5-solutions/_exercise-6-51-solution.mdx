We know from <a href="/docs/chapter-6/section-6-5#650" target="_blank">Exercise 6.50</a> that $Y_2^* = n - Y_2$ has a binomial distribution with parameters $n_2$ and $1 - p_2 = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$.
Then, using the result of Exercise 6.49, we know that $U = Y_1 + (n_2 - Y_2) = Y_1 + Y_2^*$ has a binomial distribution with parameters $n_1 + n_2$ and $p = 0.2 = \frac{1}{5}$.
(Noting that $p_1 = 1 - p_2 = 0.2$, which is a condition that must hold for the results of Exercise 6.49 to be true.)
Thus, the probability function of $U = Y_1 + n_2 - Y_2$ is

$$
p_U(u) = \binom{n_1 + n_2}{u} \left(\frac{1}{5} \right)^u \left(\frac{4}{5} \right)^{(n_1 + n_2) - u}, \quad u = 0, 1, 2, ..., n_1 + n_2.
$$

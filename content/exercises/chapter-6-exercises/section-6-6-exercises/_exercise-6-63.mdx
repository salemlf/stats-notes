In Example 6.14, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ were independent exponentially distributed random variables, both with mean $\beta$.
We deﬁned $U_1 = Y_1 / (Y_1 + Y_2)$ and $U_2 = Y_1 + Y_2$ and determined the joint density of $(U_1, U_2)$ to be

$$
f_{U_1, U_2}(u_1, u_2) =
\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{\beta^2} u_2 e^{-u_2 / \beta}, & 0 < u_1 < 1, 0 < u_2,\\
    0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

a) Show that $U_1$ is uniformly distributed over the interval $(0, 1)$.

b) Show that $U_2$ has a gamma density with parameters $\alpha = 2$ and $\beta$.

c) Establish that $U_1$ and $U_2$ are independent.

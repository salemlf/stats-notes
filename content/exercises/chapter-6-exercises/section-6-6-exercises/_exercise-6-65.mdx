Let $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ be independent standard normal random variables and $U_1 = Z_1$ and $U_2 = Z_1 + Z_2$.

a) Derive the joint density of $U_1$ and $U_2$.

b) Use Theorem 5.12 to give $E(U_1), E(U_2), V(U_1), V(U_2)$, and Cov$(U_1 , U_2)$.

c) Are $U_1$ and $U_2$ independent? Why?

d) Refer to Section 5.10. Show that $U_1$ and $U_2$ have a bivariate normal distribution.
Identify all the parameters of the appropriate bivariate normal distribution.

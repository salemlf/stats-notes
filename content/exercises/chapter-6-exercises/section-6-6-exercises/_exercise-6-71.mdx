Suppose that $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are independent exponentially distributed random variables, both with mean $\beta$, and deﬁne $U_1 = Y_1 + Y_2$ and $U_2 = Y_1 / Y_2$.

a) Show that the joint density of $(U_1, U_2)$ is

$$
f_{U_1, U_2}(u_1, u_2) =
\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{\beta^2} u_1 e^{-u_1 / \beta} \frac{1}{(1 + u_2)^2}, & 0 < u_1, 0 < u_2,\\
    0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

b) Are $U_1$ and $U_2$ independent? Why or why not?

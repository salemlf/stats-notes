Suppose that $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are independent and that both are uniformly distributed on the interval $(0, 1)$, and let $U_1 = Y_1 + Y_2$ and $U_2 = Y_1 - Y_2$.

a) Show that the joint density of $U_1$ and $U_2$ is given by

$$
f_{U_1, U_2}(u_1, u_2) =
\begin{cases}
    1 / 2, & -u_1 < u_2 < u_1, 0 < u_1 < 1 \text{ and}\\
    & u_1 - 2 < u_2 < 2 - u_1, 1 \leq u_1 < 2,\\
    0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

b) Sketch the region where $f_{U_1, U_2}(u_1, u_2) > 0$.

c) Show that the marginal density of $U_1$ is

$$
f_{U_1}(u_1) =
\begin{cases}
    u_1, & 0 < u_1 < 1,\\
    2 - u_1, & 1 \leq u_1 < 2,\\
    0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

d) Show that the marginal density of $U_2$ is

$$
f_{U_2}(u_2) =
\begin{cases}
    1 + u_2, & -1 < u_2 < 0,\\
    1 - u_2, & 0 \leq u_1 < 1,\\
    0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

e) Are $U_1$ and $U_2$ independent? Why or why not?

Refer to Exercise 6.63 and Example 6.14.
Suppose that $Y_1$ has a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha_1$ and $\beta$, that $Y_2$ is gamma distributed with parameters $\alpha_2$ and $\beta$, and that $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are independent.
Let $U_1 = Y_1 / (Y_1 + Y_2)$ and $U_2 = Y_1 + Y_2$.

a) Derive the joint density function for $U_1$ and $U_2$.

b) Show that the marginal distribution of $U_1$ is a beta distribution with parameters $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$.

c) Show that the marginal distribution of $U_2$ is a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2$ and $\beta$.

d) Establish that $U_1$ and $U_2$ are independent.

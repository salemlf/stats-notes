Let $(Y_1, Y_2)$ have joint density function $f_{Y_1, Y_2}(y_1, y_2)$ and let $U_1 = Y_1 - Y_2$ and $U_2 = Y_2$.

a) Show that the joint density of $(U_1, U_2)$ is

$$
f_{U_1, U_2}(u_1, u_2) = f_{Y_1, Y_2}(u_1 + u_2, u_2).
$$

b) Show that the marginal density function for $U_1$ is

$$
f_{U_1}(u_1) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{Y_1, Y_2}(u_1 + u_2, u_2) du_2.
$$

c) If $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are independent, show that the marginal density function for $U_1$ is

$$
f_{U_1}(u_1) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{Y_1}(u_1 + u_2) f_{Y_2}(u_2) du_2.
$$

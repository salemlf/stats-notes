The percentage of alcohol in a certain compound is a random variable $Y$, with the following density function:

$$
f(y) =
\begin{cases}
    20y^3 (1 - y), & 0 < y < 1,\\
    0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

Suppose that the compound's selling price depends on its alcohol content.
Speciﬁcally, if $1 / 3 < y < 2 / 3$, the compound sells for $C_1$ dollars per gallon; otherwise, it sells for $C_2$ dollars per gallon.
If the production cost is $C_3$ dollars per gallon, ﬁnd the probability distribution of the proﬁt per gallon.

Suppose that $Y_1$ is a binomial random variable with four trials and success probability $.2$ and that $Y_2$ is an independent binomial random variable with three trials and success probability $.5$.
Let $W = Y_1 + Y_2$.
According to Exercise 6.53(e), $W$ does not have a binomial distribution.
Find the probability mass function for $W$.
[*Hint:* $P(W = 0) = P(Y_1 = 0, Y_2 = 0)$; $P(W = 1) = P(Y_1 = 1, Y_2 = 0) + P(Y_1 = 0, Y_2 = 1)$; etc.]

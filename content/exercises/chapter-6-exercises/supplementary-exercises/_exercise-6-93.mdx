When current $I$ ï¬‚ows through resistance $R$, the power generated is given by $W = I^2 R$.
Suppose that $I$ has a uniform distribution over the interval $(0, 1)$ and $R$ has a density function given by

$$
f(r) =
\begin{cases}
    2r, & 0 \leq r \leq 1,\\
    0, & \text{elsewhere.}
\end{cases}
$$

Find the probability density function for $W$.
(Assume that $I$ is independent of $R$.)

The length of time that a machine operates without failure is denoted by $Y_1$ and the length of time to repair a failure is denoted by $Y_2$.
After a repair is made, the machine is assumed to operate like a new machine.
$Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are independent and each has the density function

$$
f(y) =
\begin{cases}
    e^{-y}, & y > 0,\\
    0, & \text{elsewhere.}
\end{cases}
$$

Find the probability density function for $U = Y_1 / (Y_1 + Y_2)$, the proportion of time that the machine is in operation during any one operation-repair cycle.

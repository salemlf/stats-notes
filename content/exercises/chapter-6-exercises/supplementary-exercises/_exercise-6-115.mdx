Let $v$ denote the volume of a three-dimensional ﬁgure.
Let $Y$ denote the number of particles observed in volume $v$ and assume that $Y$ has a Poisson distribution with mean $\lambda v$.
The particles might represent pollution particles in air, bacteria in water, or stars in the heavens.

a) If a point is chosen at random within the volume $v$, show that the distance $R$ to the nearest particle has the probability density function given by

$$
f(r) =
\begin{cases}
    4 \lambda \pi r^2 e^{-(4 / 3) \lambda \pi r^3}, & r > 0,\\
    0, & \text{elsewhere.}
\end{cases}
$$

b) If $R$ is as in part (a), show that $U = R^3$ has an exponential distribution.

A parachutist wants to land at a target $T$, but she Ô¨Ånds that she is equally likely to land at any point on a straight line $(A, B)$, of which $T$ is the midpoint.
Find the probability density function of the distance between her landing point and the target.
[*Hint:* Denote $A$ by $-1$, $B$ by $+1$, and $T$ by $0$.
Then the parachutist's landing point has a coordinate $X$, which is uniformly distributed between $-1$ and $+1$.
The distance between $X$ and $T$ is $|X|$.]

Let $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ be independent random variables, each having the same geometric distribution.

a) Find $P(Y_1 = Y_2) = P(Y_1 - Y_2 = 0)$.
[*Hint:* Your answer will involve evaluating an inﬁnite geometric series.
The results in Appendix A1.11 will be useful.]

b) Find $P(Y_1 - Y_2 = 1)$.

c) If $U = Y_1 - Y_2$, ﬁnd the (discrete) probability function for $U$.
[*Hint:* Part (a) gives $P(U = 0)$, and part (b) gives $P(U = 1)$.
Consider the positive and negative integer values for $U$ separately.]

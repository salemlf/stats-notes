Two efﬁciency experts take independent measurements $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ on the length of time workers take to complete a certain task.
Each measurement is assumed to have the density function given by

$$
f(y) =
\begin{cases}
    (1 / 4)ye^{-y / 2}, & y > 0,\\
    0, & \text{elsewhere.}
\end{cases}
$$

Find the density function for the average $U = (1 / 2)(Y_1 + Y_2)$.
[*Hint:* Use the method of moment-generating functions.]

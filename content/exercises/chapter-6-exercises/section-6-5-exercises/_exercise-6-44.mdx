The weight (in pounds) of "medium-size" watermelons is normally distributed with mean $15$ and variance $4$.
A packing container for several melons has a nominal capacity of $140$ pounds.
What is the maximum number of melons that should be placed in a single packing container if the nominal weight limit is to be exceeded only $5\%$ of the time?
Give reasons for your answer.

The length of time necessary to tune up a car is exponentially distributed with a mean of $.5$ hour.
If two cars are waiting for a tune-up and the service times are independent, what is the probability that the total time for the two tune-ups will exceed $1.5$ hours?
[*Hint*: Recall the result of Example 6.12.]

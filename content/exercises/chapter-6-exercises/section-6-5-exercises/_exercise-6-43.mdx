Refer to Exercise 6.41.
Let $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n$ be independent, normal random variables, each with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.

a) Find the density function of $\overline{Y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n Y_i$.

b) If $\sigma^2 = 16$ and $n = 25$, what is the probability that the sample mean, $\overline{Y}$, takes on a value that is within one unit of the population mean, $\mu$?
That is, find $P(|\overline{Y} - \mu| \leq 1)$.

c) If $\sigma^2 = 16$, find $P(|\overline{Y} - \mu| \leq 1)$ if $n = 36$, $n = 64$, and $n = 81$.
Interpret the results of your calculations.

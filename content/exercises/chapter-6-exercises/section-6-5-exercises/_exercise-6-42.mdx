A type of elevator has a maximum weight capacity $Y_1$, which is normally distributed with mean $5000$ pounds and standard deviation $300$ pounds.
For a certain building equipped with this type of elevator, the elevator's load, $Y_2$, is a normally distributed random variable with mean $4000$ pounds and standard deviation $400$ pounds.
For any given time that the elevator is in use, Ô¨Ånd the probability that it will be overloaded, assuming that $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are independent.

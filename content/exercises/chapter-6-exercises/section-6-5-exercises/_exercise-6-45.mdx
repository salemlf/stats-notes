The manager of a construction job needs to Ô¨Ågure prices carefully before submitting a bid.
He also needs to account for uncertainty (variability) in the amounts of products he might need.
To oversimplify the real situation, suppose that a project manager treats the amount of sand, in yards, needed for a construction project as a random variable $Y_1$, which is normally distributed with mean $10$ yards and standard deviation $.5$ yard.
The amount of cement mix needed, in hundreds of pounds, is a random variable $Y_2$, which is normally distributed with mean $4$ and standard deviation $.2$.
The sand costs \$$7$ per yard, and the cement mix costs \$$3$ per hundred pounds.
Adding \$$100$ for other costs, he computes his total cost to be

$$
U = 100 + 7Y_1 + 3Y_2.
$$

If $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are independent, how much should the manager bid to ensure that the true costs will exceed the amount bid with a probability of only $.01$?
Is the independence assumption reasonable here?

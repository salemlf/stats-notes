Let $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n$ be independent binomial random variables with $n_i$ trials probability of success given by $p_i$, $i = 1, 2, ..., n$.

a) If all of the $n_i$'s are equal and all of the $p_i$'s are equal, find the distribution of $\sum_{i = 1}^n Y_i$.

b) If all of the $n_i$'s are different and all of the $p_i$'s are equal, find the distribution of $\sum_{i = 1}^n Y_i$.

c) If all of the $n_i$'s are different and all of the $p_i$'s are equal, find the conditional distribution of $Y_1$ given $\sum_{i = 1}^n Y_i = m$.

d) If all of the $n_i$'s are different and all of the $p_i$'s are equal, find the conditional distribution of $Y_1 + Y_2$ given $\sum_{i = 1}^n Y_i = m$.

e) If all of the $p_i$'s are different, does the method of moment-generating functions work well to find the distribution of $\sum_{i = 1}^n Y_i$? Why?

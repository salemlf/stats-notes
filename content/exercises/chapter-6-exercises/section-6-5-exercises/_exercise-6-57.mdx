Let $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n$ be independent random variables such that each $Y_i$ has a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha_i$ and $\beta$.
That is, the distributions of the $Y_i$'s might have different $\alpha$'s, but all have the same value for $\beta$.
Prove that $U = Y_1 + Y_2 + ... + Y_n$ has a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + ... + \alpha_n$ and $\beta$.

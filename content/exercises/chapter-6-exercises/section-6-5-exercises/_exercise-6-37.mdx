Let $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n$ independent and identically distributed random variables such that for $0 < p < 1$, $P(Y_i = 1) = p$ and $P(Y_i = 0) = q = 1 - p$.
(Such random variables are called _Bernoulli_ random variables.)

a) Find the moment-generating function for the Bernoulli random variable $Y_1$.

b) Find the moment-generating function for $W = Y_1 + Y_2 + ... + Y_n$.

c) What is the distribution of $W$?

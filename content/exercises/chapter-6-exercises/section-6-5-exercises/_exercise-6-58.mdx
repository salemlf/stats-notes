We saw in Exercise 5.159 that the negative binomial random variable $Y$ can be written as $Y = \sum_{i = 1}^r W_i$, where $W_1, W_2, ..., W_r$ are independent geometric random variables with parameter $p$.

a) Use this fact to derive the moment-generating function for $Y$.

b) Use the moment-generating function to show that $E(Y) = r / p$ and $V(Y) = r(1 - p) / p^2$.

c) Find the conditional probability function for $W_1$, given that $Y = W_1 + W_2 + ... + W_r = m$.

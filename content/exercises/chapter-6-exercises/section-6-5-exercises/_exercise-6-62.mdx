Let $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ be independent normal random variables, each with mean $0$ and variance $\sigma^2$.
Deﬁne $U_1 = Y_1 + Y_2$ and $U_2 = Y_1 - Y_2$. Show that $U_1$ and $U_2$ are independent normal random variables, each with mean $0$ and variance $2 \sigma^2$.
[*Hint*: If $(U_1 , U_2)$ has a joint moment-generating function $m(t_1, t_2)$, then $U_1$ and $U_2$ are independent if and only if $m(t_1, t_2) = m_{U_1}(t_1) m_{U_2}(t_2)$.]

Let $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n$ be independent, uniformly distributed random variables on the interval $[0, \theta]$.

a) Find the density function of $Y_{(k)}$, the $k$th-order statistic, where $k$ is an integer between 1 and $n$.

b) Use the result from part (a) to ﬁnd $E(Y_{(k)})$.

c) Find $V(Y_{(k)})$.

d) Use the result from part (c) to ﬁnd $E(Y_{(k)} - Y_{(k−1)})$, the mean difference between two successive order statistics.
Interpret this result.

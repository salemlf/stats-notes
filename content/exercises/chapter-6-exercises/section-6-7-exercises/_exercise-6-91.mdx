Suppose that $n$ electronic components, each having an exponentially distributed length of life with mean $\theta$, are put into operation at the same time.
The components operate independently and are observed until $r$ have failed $(r \leq n)$.
Let $W_j$ denote the length of time until the $j$th failure, with $W_1 \leq W_2 \leq \cdots \leq W_r$.
Let $T_j = W_j - W_{j - 1}$ for $j \geq 2$ and $T_1 = W_1$.
Notice that $T_j$ measures the time elapsed between successive failures.

a) Show that $T_j$, for $j = 1, 2, ..., r$, has an exponential distribution with mean $\theta / (n - j + 1)$.

b) Show that

$$
U_r = \sum_{j = 1}^r W_j + (n - r)W_r = \sum_{j = 1}^r (n - j + 1) T_j
$$

and hence that $E(U_r) = r \theta$.
[$U_r$ is called the total observed life, and we can use $U_r / r$ as an approximation to (or "estimator" of) $\theta$.]

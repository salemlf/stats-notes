Refer to Exercise 6.26.
The Weibull density function is given by

$$
f(y) =
\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{\alpha} my^{m - 1} e^{-y^m / \alpha}, & y > 0,\\
    0, & \text{elsewhere,}
\end{cases}
$$

where $\alpha$ and $m$ are positive constants.
If a random sample of size $n$ is taken from a Weibull distributed population, Ô¨Ånd the distribution function and density function for $Y_{(1)} = \min(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n)$.
Does $Y_{(1)}$ have a Weibull distribution?

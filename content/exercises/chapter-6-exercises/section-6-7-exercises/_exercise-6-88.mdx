Suppose that the length of time $Y$ it takes a worker to complete a certain task has the probability density function given by

$$
f(y) =
\begin{cases}
    e^{-(y - \theta)}, & y > \theta,\\
    0, & \text{elsewhere,}
\end{cases}
$$

where $\theta$ is a positive constant that represents the minimum time until task completion.
Let $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n$ denote a random sample of completion times from this distribution.
Find

a) the density function for $Y_{(1)} = \min(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n)$.

b) $E(Y_{(1)})$.

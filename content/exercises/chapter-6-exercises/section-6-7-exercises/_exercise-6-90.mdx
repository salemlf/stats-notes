Suppose that the number of occurrences of a certain event in time interval $(0, t)$ has a Poisson distribution.
If we know that $n$ such events have occurred in $(0, t)$, then the actual times, measured from $0$, for the occurrences of the event in question form an ordered set of random variables, which we denote by $W_{(1)} \leq W_{(2)} \leq \cdots \leq W_{(n)}$.
[$W_{(i)}$ actually is the waiting time from $0$ until the occurrence of the $i$th event.]
It can be shown that the joint density function for $W_{(1)}, W_{(2)}, ..., W_{(n)}$ is given by

$$
f(w_1, w_2, ..., w_n) =
\begin{cases}
    \frac{n!}{t^n}, & w_1 \leq w_2 \leq \cdots \leq w_n,\\
    0, & \text{elsewhere.}
\end{cases}
$$

[This is the density function for an ordered sample of size $n$ from a uniform distribution on the interval $(0, t)$.]
Suppose that telephone calls coming into a switchboard follow a Poisson distribution with a mean of ten calls per minute.
A slow period of two minutes' duration had only four calls.
Find the

a) probability that all four calls came in during the ﬁrst minute; that is, ﬁnd $P(W_{(4)} \leq 1)$.

b) expected waiting time from the start of the two-minute period until the fourth call.

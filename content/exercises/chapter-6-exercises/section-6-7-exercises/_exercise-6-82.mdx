If $Y$ is a continuous random variable and $m$ is the median of the distribution, then $m$ is such that $P(Y \leq m) = P(Y \geq m) = 1 / 2$.
If $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n$ are independent, exponentially distributed random variables with mean $\beta$ and median $m$, Example 6.17 implies that $Y_{(n)} = \max(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n)$ _does not_ have an exponential distribution.
Use the general form of $F_{Y_{(n)}}(y)$ to show that $P(Y_{(n)} > m) = 1 - (.5)^n$.

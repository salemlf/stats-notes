Let $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n$ be independent, uniformly distributed random variables on the interval $[0, \theta]$.

a) Find the joint density function of $Y_{(j)}$ and $Y_{(k)}$ where $j$ and $k$ are integers $1 \leq j < k \leq n$.

b) Use the result from part (a) to ﬁnd $\text{Cov}(Y_{(j)}, Y_{(k)})$ when $j$ and $k$ are integers $1 \leq j < k \leq n$.

c) Use the result from part (b) and Exercise 6.76 to ﬁnd $V(Y_{(k)} - Y_{(j)})$, the variance of the difference between two order statistics.
